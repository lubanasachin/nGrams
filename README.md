n-Grams
====

# Introduction
nGrams is a PHP library to parse long texts into unique n-grams
and it does not have dependencies, which is ideal for shared hosting.
It reads the continuous input stream from standard input 
and print the unique ngrams, one-per-line, as they are detected in the input stream.

# Requirements
* PHP 5.3.x or higher
* PHPUnit 3.7.* (for running tests only)
